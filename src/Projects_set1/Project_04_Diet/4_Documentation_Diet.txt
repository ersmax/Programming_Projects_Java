A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly
used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is
desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know
how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a
program to supply the answer. The program has no input but does have defined
constants for the following items: the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill
a mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting weight of the dieter, and the desired
weight of the dieter. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses
the weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current
weight, to calculate how much soda pop the dieter can safely drink. You may use
any reasonable values for these defined constants. Assume that diet soda contains
1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use another named constant for this fraction.
You may want to express the percent as the double value 0.001. (If your program
turns out not to use a defined constant, you may remove that defined constant
from your program.)

Program Documentation: Diet Soda Safety Calculator

Overview
This program calculates the safe amount of diet soda a person can consume
without risking death due to the artificial sweetener it contains.
The calculation is based on the lethal dose of sweetener for a mouse,
the weight of the mouse, and the desired weight of the person.

Features
1. Calculates the lethal dose of sweetener for a person based on their desired weight.
2. Determines the safe amount of diet soda (in grams) that can be consumed.
3. Outputs the safe quantity of soda in grams.

Code Explanation
1. Package Declaration: The program is part of the `Projects_set1.Project_04_Diet` package.
2. Constants:
   - `SWEETNER_TO_KILL_MOUSE`: Amount of sweetener that kills a mouse (in grams).
   - `WEIGHT_MOUSE`: Weight of the mouse (in grams).
   - `STARTING_WEIGHT`: Initial weight of the person (not used in calculations).
   - `DESIRED_WEIGHT`: Target weight of the person (used for safety calculations).
   - `PERCENTAGE_SWEETNER`: Proportion of sweetener in diet soda (0.001 or 0.1%).
3. Main Method:
   - Calculates the lethal dose of sweetener for the person (`fatalGrams`).
   - Computes the safe amount of soda (`safeDosage`) based on the sweetener content.
   - Outputs the safe quantity of soda in grams.

How to Run
1. Compile the program using `javac Diet.java`.
2. Run the program using `java Projects_set1.Project_04_Diet.Diet`.
3. The program will display the safe quantity of diet soda in grams.

Assumptions
- The desired weight is used for safety calculations, not the starting weight.
- The sweetener proportion in diet soda is 0.1% (0.001).

Limitations
- The program does not handle user input; all values are hardcoded.
- Assumes all constants are accurate and reasonable.

Enhancements
- Allow user input for weights and sweetener proportions.
- Add input validation to ensure realistic values.

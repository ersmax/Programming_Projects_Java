Body Mass Index (BMI) helps in specifying the weight category a person
belongs to, depending on their body weight. BMI is estimated using the following
formula:
BMI = (Weight in kilograms)/(Height in meters)^2
Write a program that calculates and outputs the BMI. Assume various input values
wherever required.

---

## Assumptions
The user inputs valid numerical values for weight and height.
Weight is in kilograms, and height is in meters.

## Limitations
The program does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values).
It does not categorize the BMI into weight categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight).

## Enhancements
Add input validation to handle invalid or negative values.
Include BMI categorization based on standard BMI ranges.
